<PRE>NEW features of cdrtools-2.01.01a28:

---------&gt;
******** WARNING! This is a release that introduces _massive_ changes
******** in mkisofs. These changes are not yet and cannot yet be complete
******** and are definitely not tested sufficiently already.
******** If you like to test the recent massive mkisofs enhencements, you
******** are welcome! If you lik a &quot;stable&quot; version, ise mkisofs from
******** Cdrtools-2.01.01a27
&lt;--------

All:

-	Support for SunStudio 12 on Linux was added.
	Call &quot;make CCOM=suncc&quot;, but note that you then
	will not be able to compile Linux specific functions like
	support for ext2 file flags. This does not work because the
	related include files are not written in clean C.

	Note that nearly all programs from cdrtools depend on libscg
	which uses platform speficic code for every OS. As the Linux
	kernel include files are not written in clean C, you cannot
	compile libscg using Sun Studio. If someone from the Linux kernel
	team would rewrite the Linux kernel include files to only use clean
	C based constructs, cdrecord could be compiled with Sun Studio
	compilers.

-	Added a workaround to config.guess to get correct
	platform names from &quot;configure&quot; even thogh suncc 
	does not #define __ELF__

-	Linux specific autoconf tests are not only executed on Linux
	based platforms

-	Some make rule definitions for Cygwin restructured to allow
	compilation with more Cygwin releases. The -D_WIN32_WINNT=
	definitions are now only in effect if the selected compiler
	is the Microsoft compiler.

-	New include file schily/ioctl.h


-	Added Support to create Blastwave SVr4 packages.
	To create a Blastwave package, call:

		.clean
		smake -f Mcsw

	You need the program &quot;fakeroot&quot; and will find the results
	in packages/&lt;arch-dir&gt;

	Note that this source tree will allow you to create the package
	CSWcdrtools but not the packages CSWschilybase and CSWschilyutils
	on which CSWcdrtools depends.

	WARNING: libsiconv.a and it's character translation tables (located in 
	/opt/*/lib/siconv) are not part of CSWcdrtools but of CSWschilybase.
	If you do not update CSWschilybase to include the character translation
	tables used by libsiconv, mkisofs will not work correctly.

	NOTE: the SVr4 package specific rules are approx. 10 lines of make rules.
	It should be simple to create rule definitions for other package systems
	found on platforms other than Solaris. Volunteers who like to help
	to deveop support for other packaging systems are welcome!


Libschily:


Libparanoia (Ported/enhanced by J&#246;rg Schilling, originated by Monty <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/cdrecord-video">xiphmont at mit.edu</A>):

-	&quot;make install&quot; now also installs the READMEs and other docukmentation to
	..../share/doc/libparanoia/


Libedc (Optimized by J&#246;rg Schilling, originated by Heiko Ei&#223;feldt <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/cdrecord-video">heiko at hexco.de</A>):

Libfind:

Libfile:

Libhfs_iso:

Libsiconv:

-	New library libsiconv replaces libunls.
	Libsiconv saves ~ 130 kB of executable space in mkisofs and allows to use
	iconv() if it is present on the current polatform.

Libscg:

Rscsi:

-	&quot;make install&quot; now also installs the READMEs and other docukmentation to
	..../share/doc/rscsi/

Cdrecord:

-	&quot;make install&quot; now also installs the READMEs and other docukmentation to
	..../share/doc/cdrecord/

-	New function verify() in high level code.

Cdda2wav (Maintained/enhanced by J&#246;rg Schilling, originated by Heiko Ei&#223;feldt <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/cdrecord-video">heiko at hexco.de</A>):

-	&quot;make install&quot; now also installs the READMEs and other docukmentation to
	..../share/doc/cdda2wav/

Readcd:

Scgcheck:

Scgskeleton:

-	New merged code from the &quot;sformat&quot; and &quot;cdrecord&quot; consolidation.

-	Bumped to version 1.2

Btcflash:

Mkisofs (Maintained/enhanced by J&#246;rg Schilling since 1997, originated my Eric Youngdale):

-	&quot;make install&quot; now also installs the READMEs and other docukmentation to
	..../share/doc/mkisofs/

-	The change from libunls to libsiconv fixes a lot of bugs in the
	character translation tables. libsiconv now uses the official tables
	from Unicode.org. Any other &quot;single char&quot; -&gt; UNICODE table from
	Unicode.org may be taken unmodified and copied to /opt/schily/lib/libsiconv
	to become usable by libsiconv.

	If you use the same character set names as with old mkisofs, you get
	the character translations from the tables in /opt/schily/lib/libsiconv,
	if you use ICONV based locale names and iconv() is available on your
	platform, then mkisofs used iconv() to translate the character encodings.

	If you like to force to use the iconv() code, use something like:

	mkisofs -input-charset iconv:8859-1

	****** IMPORTANT ********

	You need to install the table files from libsiconv to make mkisofs 
	behave correctly.

-	Thanks to the new libsiconv, mkisofs now supports to run in a UTF-8 locale.
	As long as no automatic locale support is present, call

	mkisofs -input-charset UTF-8

-	Completed the Symlink implementation for UDF. The code was 20% ready
	from Helios.de from the includes from the Helios variant of mkisofs.

-	New option -no-udfsymlinks to turn off support for UDF symlinks.
	The UDF standards requires any OS to implement symlink support, but
	you never know...

-	New option -UDF implements non-anonymous UDF support.
	The relation between -UDF vs. -udf is the same as with -R vs. -r

-	Integrated a larger code drop from Helios.de, thanks to Helmut Tschemernjak
	from helios.de. We did integrate the following new features from Helios.de:

	-	Support for UID/GID in the UDF file meta data

	-	Support for permissions in the UDF file meta data

	-	Support for Mac OS X &quot;/..namedfork/rsrc&quot;

	-	Avoid Mac OS X syslog entries when &quot;/rsrc&quot; is used.

	-	Support for UDF based Mac OS extensions (type/creator and 
		resource forks).

	-	New option -no-hfs allows to turn off creating a ISO9660/HFS hybrid
		when UDF based Mac OS extensions are used.

	-	Do not chache resorce fork files in the inode cache anymore.

	We did not include the following code from the Helios.de code drop:

	-	Helios UNICODE unification (always tries to create &quot;complete&quot;
		characters if e.g. a '&#246;' is written as 'o'+'&quot;', this is translated
		into a '&#246;'.

		The reason for not integrating this code is that it did violate
		constraints from mkisofs. The translation was done based on UTF-8
		regardless of the current locale of the user. It could only work
		in a UTF-8 based locale but mkisofs did not yet support UTF-8 an
		based locale. The correct implementation would be in most cases
		based on UCS-2 characters as used by Joliet and UDF.

	-	Helios code that did prevent mkisofs to abort on certain kind of 
		read errors.

		The reason for not integrating this code is that it did not work
		as expected for all possible cases and that such code should use
		a similar mechanism as &quot;star&quot;s error control feature.

	-	The Helios option -nolimit-pathtables has not been included as the
		implementation did cause the PATH table to contain random data in 
		case that a PATH table overflow was allowed.

	-	The Helios code drop did modify the libfind callback function to
		implement Mac OS extensions. This is not correct as all the Mac OS
		related stuff should already in the functions that are called
		by the unmodified libfind callback.

		Another problem with this code is that it would introduce an 
		otherwise non-existent path length limitation with &quot;mkisofs -find &quot;

	-	Helios did remove the artificial limit for UDF files &gt; 2 GB.
		This is currently not done for consistency between ISO-9660 and
		UDF. Mkisofs will implement multi-extent files soon and then
		the UDF file size limitation will be removed.


	HELIOS TODO:

	-	Add better code for ignoring errors. This should be done
		using star's error control module, see star/checkerr.c

	-	Add some code that allows to write media with more than 65535
		parent directories, even if this violates ISO-9660 and prevents
		DOS from being able to read the resulting FS. This needs to be
		done in a way that causes all &quot;overflowing&quot; directories to get
		a definitive pointer instead of random values.

	-	Add the HELIOS UNICODE mapping code. This needs to be done 
		at UCS-2 level for Joliet and UDF (instead of UTF-8) and only
		for Rock Ridge (in case of a UTF-8 based target locale) using
		UTF-8 based translations.

	-	Make the Apple extensions work again with &quot;mkisofs -find&quot;

TODO:
	-	Support correct inode numbers for UDF hardlinks

	-	Support sockets, pipes, char/blk-dev specials with UDF

	-	read Joliet filenames with multi-session if no TRANS.TBL
		or RR is present. I am looking for a volunteer for this task!

		Note that this can never be 100% correct as there is no relation
		between the names on the master (UNIX) filesystem, the ISO-9660
		names and the Joliet names. Only the Rock Ridge names are
		untranslated with respect to the original files on the
		master (UNIX) filesystem.

	-	add libecc/edc for CDI and similar.
